**Workshop for the Integration Tests Webinar.**

In this workshop, we have our own service which calls external dependency - Google Translation Service. The goal of the workshop is to create tests by mocking external dependency, making sure it gets called whenever expected, and that it is not - when it shouldn't be.

`MyTranslationServiceTest_TODO` has the test templates created. The task is to fill those templates with corresponding code.
